# Here we define the release action which releases all
#  modifier-keys used within this grammar.  It is defined here
#  because this functionality is used in many different places.
#  Note that it is harmless to release ("...:up") a key multiple
#  times or when that key is not held down at all.

# Here we define various functions for formatting text.
# Each of these functions must have a docstring which defines its
